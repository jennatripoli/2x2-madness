How to execute the code:

1. Create a new react project. Open the terminal in the desired location of the application (not in this src folder) and type "npx create-react-app 2x2-madness". This will create a directory called "2x2-madness".

2. Move all the files from this folder into the "2x2-madness/src" directory.

3. Open the terminal in the "2x2-madness" directory and type "npm start". This will launch a browser window with the application running. Type "npm test -- --coverage" to run code coverage tests.
