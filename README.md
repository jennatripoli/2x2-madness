# 2x2 Madness

2x2 Madness is a puzzle game built using JavaScript and React, using a Model-Boundary-Controller architecture. It features a Canvas object for rendering and JSON-based board configurations for flexible gameplay setup. The application has 97% test coverage.

The game takes place on an N x N grid, where each square can be assigned a color. At the center of every 2x2 group of squares is a circle that allows players to select and interact with that group. By clicking on a circle, the corresponding 2x2 group can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise, shifting the positions of the colors within that group. Players must strategically rotate the groups to align colors. When all squares within a selected 2x2 group share the same color, the group is cleared from the board. The ultimate objective is to clear all colored squares, leaving the board empty.
